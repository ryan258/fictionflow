Return JSON only:
{
  "retell": "2-sentence literal summary of what happens",
  "stakes": "1 sentence: what the narrator wants / what's in the way",
  "confusions": [{"quote":"...","why":"...","fix_hint":"structural|line"}],
  "strengths": [{"quote":"...","why":"..."}],
  "ratings": {"clarity":0-3,"stakes":0-3,"momentum":0-3,"ending_resonance":0-3}
}
Rules: Quote exact spans for each confusion/strength. No style judgements without a quote.
Deep POV check: Flag any filter words (I saw, I heard, I felt, I thought, I noticed, I realized) or narrative distance as confusions.
